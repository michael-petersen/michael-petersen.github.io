	    <h4><font size="3">Provided by WiSTEM:<br> “In the era of Big Data, a lack of gender disaggregated data, or even any data on women at all, can make life harder for women. From Machine Learning  algorithms that are trained on biased information, to car designs that mean women are more likely to be injured in a crash, a lack of female perspectives in many arenas has contributed to a pervasive bias with a profound effect on women’s lives.
 
We will explore some examples of data gaps and their repercussions, and then discuss if we see any examples in our lives inside and outside of work. Finally we will analyse the science and technology that we work on and how we can contribute to closing the data gap.” </font></h4>

            <h3>On Meritocracy</h3>

	    <p>[p. 95] "If white upper-class Americans are most likely to believe in the myth of meritocracy, it should come as no surprse that academia is, like tech, a strong follower of the religion. The upper ranks of academia -- particularly those of sciece, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) -- are dominated by white, middle- and upper-class men. [...] Accordingly, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/43/13201">a recent study</a> found that male academics -- particularly those in STEM -- rated fake research claiming that academia had no gender bias higher than real research which showed it did."</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>[p. 277] "Clare Castillejo, a specialist in fragile states, writes that women's influence in government is often limited by their exclusion from male-dominated patronage networks. Women may be present at formal talks [in the context of governmental negotiations], but this isn't much good if the men are forming back room quid pro quo networks (something Castillejo cautions is particularly common in post-conflict settings) and going off to have the real discussion in 'informal spaces that women cannot access.' "</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>[p. 283] "It has become fashionable for modern workplaces to relax what are often seen as outmoded relics of a less egalitarian age: out with stuffy hierarchies, in with flat organisational structures. But the problem with the absence of a formal hierarchy is that it doesn't actually result in an absence of a hierarchy altogether. It just means that the unspoken, implicit, profoundly non-egalitarian structure reasserts itself, with white men at the top and the rest of us fighting for a piece of the small space left for everyone else. Group-discussion approaches like brainstorming, explains female leadership trainer Gayna Williams, are <a href="http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/january-february-2014/are-you-sure-your-software-is-gender-neutral">'well known to be loaded with challenges for diverse representation'</a>, because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/upshot/speaking-while-female-and-at-a-disadvantage.html">already-dominant voices dominate</a>."</p>
            <br>

            <h3>On Statistics</h3>

			<p>
			[p. 255] "A zombie stat is a spurious statistic that won't die -- in part because it feels intuitively right. In the case of the UK's 2017 general election we needed an explanation for why, contrary to nearly all polling predictions, the Labour Party did so well. An unprecedented increase in youth turnout fitted the bill: Labour had courted the youth vote, the story went, and it had almost won."
</p>
<br> 
			<p>
			[p. 180] "When it comes to the tech that ends up in our pockets (I'm ever hopeful), it all comes down to who is making the decisions. And like the world of venture capitalists, the tech industry is dominated by men. Margaret Mitchell calls this the 'sea of dudes' problem. Over the past five years she's worked with around ten women and 'hundreds' of men. Across 'professional computing' as a whole in the US, 26% of jobs are held by women compared to the 57% of jobs women hold across the entire US workforce. In the UK, women make up 14% of the STEM workforce."
</p>
<br>
					  <h3>On Bias in Algorithms</h3>

<p>
			[p. 179] "Gender affects the kinds of questions we ask, says Margaret Mitchell, senior research scientist at Google. Limiting AI developers to one gender, she told Bloomberg News, puts companies 'in a position of myopia'. Gayna Williams, ex-direct of user experience at Microsoft, agrees. In a blogpost titled 'Are you sure your software is gender-neutral?' Williams explains that all product design begins by deciding which problem needs solving. And that is all a matter of perception: what problem were NASA scientists solving when they decided to give <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/16/women-vs-the-machine/">Valkyrie, their space-navigation robot, breasts?</a>"
			</p>
	<br>
<p>
			[p. 163] "Rachel Tatman rubbishes the suggestion that the problem lies in women's voices rather than the technology that doesn't recognise them: studies have found that women have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2994697/">'significantly higher speech intelligibility'</a>, perhaps because women thend to produce <a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/P08-1044">longer vowel sounds</a> and tend to speak <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2790192/">slightly more slowly than men</a>. Meanwhile, men have 'higher rates of disfluency, produce words with slightly shorter durations, and use more alternate ('sloppy') pronunciations. With all this in mind, voice-recognition technology should, if anything find it easier to recognise female rather than male voices -- and indeed, Tatman writes that she has 'trained classifiers on speech data from women and they worked just fine, thank you very much'."
</p>

<br>
					  <h3>On Takeaways</h3>

<p>
			[p. 314] "There is one more trend I kept coming across while writing this book: the excuses. Chief amongst these is that women are just too complicated to measure. Everyone was saying this, from transport planners, to medical researchers, to tech developers: they were all knocking their heads up against Freud's riddle of femininity and come away baffled and defeated. Female bodies are too unharmonious, too menstrual an too hormonal. Women's travel patterns are too messy, their work schedules are too aberrant, their voices are too high. Even when, in the early twentieth century, influential Swiss architect Le Corbusier was devising a standard human model for us in architecture, the female body was 'only belatedly considered and rejected as a source of proportional harmony', with humanity instead represented by a six-foot man with his arm raised (to reach that top shelf I can never reach)."
</p>
<br>
<p>
			[p. 318] "The solution to the sex and gender data gap is clear: we have to close the female representation gap. When women are involved in decision-making, in research, in knowledge production, women do not get forgotten. Female lives and perspectives are brought out of the shadows. This is to the benefit of women everywhere. [...] And so, to return to Freud's 'riddle of femininity', it turns out that the answer was staring us in the face all along. All 'people' needed to do was to ask women."
