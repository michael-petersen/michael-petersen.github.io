Discussion questions:

1. Why are most dwarfs observed at pericentre?

2. Are the mass computations reasonable?

1. What are the differences from globular clusters (classic, dense GCs/extended GCs)?
What can we say about the GCs from our current perspective?
How do the UFDs relate to the extended globular clusters?

2. How can we use next-generation telescopes to learn about the dwarfs?
How can we make progress on the technical challenge of simulating gas and stars together?

3. Dark-matter physics!

Missing out on the necessary observations to look at the IMF in dwarfs -- cannot firmly say anything about differences from GCs yet.

New questions:

1. Where are the LMC satellites?
2. Is the designation of 'Ultra-Faint Star Clusters' valid?
