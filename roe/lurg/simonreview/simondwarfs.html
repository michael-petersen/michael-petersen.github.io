<h1>Interactive Figures from Simon (2018).</h1>
<div class="chart" id="chart">
  <p class="parafont"> Figure 1. "Distribution of MilkyWay satellites in absolute magnitude (MV) and half-light radius. Confirmed dwarf
galaxies are displayed as dark blue filled circles, and objects suspected to be dwarf galaxies but for which the
available data are not conclusive are shown as cyan filled circles. Dwarf galaxy candidates without any
published classification (usually because of the lack of spectroscopy) are shown as open gray circles. The faint
candidates with R1/2 > 50 pc are almost certainly dwarf galaxies, but we do not include them in the
confirmed category here given the currently available observations. The open black diamonds represent the Milky
Way globular clusters (Harris 1996, the 2010 edition of the online catalog). Lines of constant central
surface brightness (at 25, 27, 29, and 31 mag arcsec -2 in V band) are plotted in pink. For stellar systems
brighter than MV = -5 there is no ambiguity in classification:
  Globular clusters have R1/2 < 20 pc, and
dwarf galaxies have R1/2 > 100 pc. At fainter magnitudes the size distributions begin to impinge upon each
other, and classification based purely on photometric parameters may not always be possible. Whether the
two populations actually occupy nonoverlapping portions of this parameter space remains to be determined
from spectroscopy of the faintest stellar systems with half-light radii between 10 and 40 pc."</p>
