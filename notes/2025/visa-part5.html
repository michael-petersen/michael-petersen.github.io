            <h2>Visa application (part 5)</h2>
            <br>
	          <p>I am finally done with applying for visas: I have indefinite leave to remain in the UK.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But as with every other piece of this process, it has been a gigantic, expensive faff. This time, it is £3049 to apply for indefinite leave to remain, with an optional £1000 to fast-track the application. The return on investment for the fast-track is unfortunately enormous: dropping the quoted timeline from 26 weeks to 2 business days. So yes, I did pay to fast track the application, which has the added advantage of giving access to all TLS racket services. Which I guess really just says that the government is more intertwined with TLS than I figured.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This application does not have an NHS surcharge -- I guess as a tax-paying resident I have finally been acknowledged as helping to fund the NHS through taxes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Then we have to use the TLS racket service, which is an additional 158 EUR for a 'Flexi Appointment' because there are no free appointments available.</p>
