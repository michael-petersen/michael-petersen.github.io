            <h2>Bicycle Commuting II</h2>
              <p>30 March 2025</p>
              <p>(this post talks about my most recent bicycle, if you are interested in my earlier bicycle, see <a href="../2019/bicycling.html">here</a>.)</p>
              <br>
              <p>After the sad end to my first Edinburgh bicycle, I purchased a 2023 Cube Attain Road Bicycle on 30 March 2025. Because this was well after the date the bicycle was new, it was discounted from £999 to £499.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Some stream-of-consciousness thoughts: the larger bicycle means it is harder to ride up out of the saddle, as I already have a more upright posture while riding. The 2023 edition of the Attain still features quick-release wheels; this is something to keep in mind when needing to replace them (as happened on the old bicycle).</p>
