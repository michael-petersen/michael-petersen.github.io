            <h2>Bicycle Commuting II</h2>
              <p>30 March 2025</p>
              <p>(this post talks about my most recent bicycle, if you are interested in my earlier bicycle, see <a href="../2019/bicycling.html">here</a>.)</p>
              <br>
              <p>After the sad end to my first Edinburgh bicycle (stolen from our stair!), I purchased a 2023 Cube Attain Road Bicycle on 30 March 2025. Because this was well after the date the bicycle was new, it was discounted from £999 to £499.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Some stream-of-consciousness thoughts: the larger bicycle means it is harder to ride up out of the saddle, as I already have a more upright posture while riding. The 2023 edition of the Attain still features quick-release wheels; this is something to keep in mind when needing to replace them (as happened on the old bicycle).</p>

At first service (24 April 2025), cables were re-stretched. Discussed 'piston-fixed' construction of the brake pads; on this bicycle the brake pad is only pushed from the outside in, and the location of the inner pad can be moved with a 5mm wrench. The wobbling I felt on the brakes came from the inner bad being in too far, forcing the outer piston to overextend and feel like the rotor was being warped.
This bicycle also has a 'trim shift' where the front gears have two settings each (even though the chain won't move off the gear). This helps with alignment in the smaller or larger casette gears.


Mileage estimate:
2.2 miles one way from home to ROE (W,F)
3.8 miles one way if including nursery route (M,T)
1.3 miles one way to music class (R)
An average commuting week is then (2.2*4) + (3.8*4) + (1.3*2) = 26.6 miles
Baseline year is then 1400ish miles.
Plus anything on top of the commute!

1 June 2025. First puncture, rear tire, from leftover construction debris in our entry. Annoying! I patched the tube.

8 July 2025. Rear tire flat after parking overnight at Waverley. Replaced the tube on 9 July, bought £8 tube from Bruntsfield Cycles.
