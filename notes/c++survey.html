            <h2>How did (some) astronomers learn C++?</h2>
            <br>
      	    <p>A whole class of high-performance computing (HPC) problems exist in astronomy. C++ is currently the workhorse language, largely dominating production codes for the better part of three decades.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But, learning C++ is a bear. As I've been working with students, I've been mulling over how one teaches an appropriate amount of C++ without requiring extra dedicated coursework. Or maybe such a task is impossible, and dedicated coursework is really needed!</p>
            <br>
            <p>To that end, I've been chatting with different astronomers (a highly subjective list of people that I work with!) and started to compile a list of `where did astronomers learn C++?`, as well as thinking about resources to take the best components of how astronomers have learned in order to construct an astronomy-specific pedagogy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>First, see the `standard` tutorial on <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">cplusplus.com</a>.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Me (35 year old postdoc theorist). Weakly proficient. Learned by example, looking at other's full code bases, augmented with online tutorials and lots of stack overflow.</p>
            <br>
            <p>60 year old faculty theorist. Very proficient. Learned from books, keeping up with modern standards as they were developed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>25 year old graduate student. Very proficient. Learned from a 'Computing systems' class that taught C. After that, C++ was a logical jump with easier memory management.</p>
