              <p>1 January 2026</p>
              <p>I'm in a somewhat precarious position now for employment as a professional astronomer. Given that I've been bouncing from contract to contract for a while now, this isn't particularly surprising, but to prepare for future steps, I'm thinking about what I really like about academia, and research, and projects. These notes have been helpful for looking back at -- even if I've historically left them a bit vague.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Over the next couple of months, I'm going to grow the content on this page as a challenge to myself to produce some projects that I care about. I have some ideas, but I won't yet fully commit myself to them.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Things I have measured:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electricity (directly at outlets with a power meter, in the whole flat with a smart meter, inside appliances with a volt meter).</li>
                    <li>Everything coffee (scales, water, every coffee since 2015)</li>
                    <li>Temperature and humidity in the flat</li>
                    <li>Light in the flat</li>
                    <li>Accelerometer data from my phone</li>
                    <li>Gas usage in the flat</li>
                    <li>Sugar content and alcohol content in liquids</li>
                </ul>
              <br>
