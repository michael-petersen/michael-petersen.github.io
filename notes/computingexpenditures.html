            <h2>How much computing budget do I need?</h2>
            <p>(This post is backdated to when I switched to my current setup, but it features more recent updates.)</p>
            <br>
        	  <p>I fully admit that I'm a bit weird about spending grant money and new computers. I've personally purchased both of the laptops that I use for science research (although I'm a huge proponent of shared resources, and computing clusters), and I use the computers as workhorses for absolutely everything I want to do with a computer. I fully admit that I waited too long to upgrade my first graduate school laptop, which I write more about below.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To that end, I try to both (a) keep compulsive track of how much I'm spending, and (b) try to understand as much as possible why I am investing in something. I'm also counting all my computer peripherals.</p>

            <p>I'm currently on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). I ordered this machine on April 27th, 2015. I purchased this machine online, for $1,878.</p>

In January 2022, I upgraded to macOS Catalina, 10.15.7

I've always been fortunate enough to have access to external monitors through offices. These are a cost that I would need if I decided to work elsewhere!

In France, I bought several peripherials to make my life easier.
External Keyboard
External mouse
Headset
Microphone (not strictly needed)
Laptop stand


I repaired the computer at SimplyFixIt in Bruntsfield. (May 14, 2021)

First was an inspection, for £99. FAULT SYMPTOMS / PROBLEM : Touch pad and keyboard not working
intermittently
JOB REQUESTED BY CUSTOMER:
Please investigate and update
customer
BOOK-IN INSPECTION: Screen coating peeling away and palmrest edge has damage

I then spent an additional £327 on May 18, 2021 to replace the cable connecting the power adapter, the cable connecting the keyboard and mouse setup, and the battery.

Original order. I maxed out many of the options to try and make the computer live as long as possible.
13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display

$1,878.00

With the following configuration:

•	3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz
•	16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM
•	256GB PCIe-based Flash Storage
•	Intel Iris Graphics 6100
•	Force Touch trackpad
•	Accessory Kit
•	Backlit Keyboard (English) & User's Guide
•	Apple Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter

(environmental report at https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/notebooks/13inchMacBookPro_wRetinaDisplay_PER_march2015.pdf)

I also bought at $9.99 MagSafe to MagSafe 2 converter.

To cover the computer, I bought a hard side rubberised case for $24.99 (still going as of Jan 2022)
I also bought a keyboard cover for $7.95, which is very broken in Jan 2022, but also tells a super interesting story of exactly how I type.

Also external hard drives:
4 TB western digital <- new time machine
500GB SanDisk (workhorse)
1TB SanDisk
1TB external (brand?) <- old time machine
32GB sticks (real thesis workhorses!)

I'd also be lying if I said I didn't use my phone for work from time to time. I will also count it as part of the cost!

The iPhone 6s was released in September 2015, retailing for $749 as the 64GB model.

Old notes:
I bought Corsair Apple 8 GB Dual Channel Kit DDR3 1066 (PC3 8500) 204-Pin DDR3 Laptop SO-DIMM Memory for $37.99 in August 2016. I also had to buy Torx scredrivers at the same time.

I paid $1049 for the original Macbook pro laptop.

This computer is maxed out at macOS High Sierra 10.13.6

2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (1 processor, 2 cores). 3 MB L2 cache.
Started with 4 GB memry, later upgraded.

Purchased a Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250GB to upgrade the spinning drive. This was easily the biggest difference in the machine's lifespan.

Purchased a new battery (when?). Jan 2022: 3510 mAh charge, 189 cycles. 90 mA, 9662 mV.

One new wall charger purchased.
