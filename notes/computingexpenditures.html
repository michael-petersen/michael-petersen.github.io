            <h2>How much computing budget do I need?</h2>
            <p>(This post is backdated to when I switched to my current setup, but it features more recent updates.)</p>
            <br>
        	  <p>I fully admit that I'm a bit weird about spending grant money and new computers. I've personally purchased both of the laptops that I use for science research (although I'm a huge proponent of shared resources, à la compute clusters), and I use the computers as workhorses for absolutely everything I want to do with a computer. I fully admit that I waited too long to upgrade my first graduate school laptop, which I write more about below.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To that end, I try to both (a) keep compulsive track of how much I'm spending, and (b) try to understand as much as possible why I am investing in something. I'm also counting all my computer peripherals.</p>

            <p>I'm currently on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). I ordered this machine on April 27th, 2015. I purchased this machine online, for $1,878.</p>

In January 2022, I upgraded to macOS Catalina, 10.15.7

I've always been fortunate enough to have access to external monitors through offices. These are a cost that I would need if I decided to work elsewhere!

In France, I bought several peripherials to make my life easier.
External Keyboard
External mouse
Headset
Microphone (not strictly needed)
Laptop stand


I repaired the computer at SimplyFixIt in Bruntsfield. (May 14, 2021)

First was an inspection, for £99. FAULT SYMPTOMS / PROBLEM : Touch pad and keyboard not working
intermittently
JOB REQUESTED BY CUSTOMER:
Please investigate andupdate
customer
BOOK-IN INSPECTION: Screen coating peeling away and palmrest edge has damage

I then spent £327 on May 18, 2021 to replace the cable connecting

Original order. I maxed out many of the options to try and make the computer live as long as possible.
13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display

$1,878.00

With the following configuration:

•	3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz

I also bought at $9.99 MagSafe to MagSafe 2 converter.

To cover the computer, I bought a hard side rubberised case for $24.99 (still going as of Jan 2022)
I also bought a keyboard cover for $7.95, which is very broken in Jan 2022, but also tells a super interesting story of exactly how I type.

I'd also be lying if I said I didn't use my phone for work from time to time. I will also count it as part of the cost!


Old notes:
I bought Corsair Apple 8 GB Dual Channel Kit DDR3 1066 (PC3 8500) 204-Pin DDR3 Laptop SO-DIMM Memory for $37.99 in August 2016. I also had to buy Torx scredrivers at the same time.

I paid $1049 for the original Macbook pro laptop.
