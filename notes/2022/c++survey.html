            <h2>How did (some) astronomers learn C++?</h2>
            <br>
      	    <p>A whole class of high-performance computing (HPC) problems exist in astronomy. I'm interested in HPC problems relating to N-body dynamics and kinetic theory of self-gravitating systems. C++ is currently the workhorse language, largely dominating production codes for the better part of three decades. I'll put together a note about my experience learning Julia soon!</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>Learning C++ is a bear.</i> As I've been working with students, I've been mulling over how one teaches an appropriate amount of C++ without requiring extra dedicated coursework. Or maybe such a task is impossible, and dedicated coursework is really needed!</p>
            <br>
            <p>To that end, I've been chatting with different astronomers (a highly subjective list of people that I work with!) and started to compile a list of `where did astronomers learn C++?`, as well as thinking about resources to take the best components of how astronomers have learned in order to construct an astronomy-specific pedagogy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>First, see the `standard` tutorial on <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">cplusplus.com</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Converting Python code to C++. Start with maximising the object-oriented structure of the Python code. Many functions will be straightforward to convert to C++: functions that return single values are king. What about doing some timing tests for pointer passing?</p>

            <br>
            <p>Me (35 year old postdoc theorist). Weakly proficient. Learned by example, looking at other's full code bases, augmented with online tutorials and lots of stack overflow. Coded up little examples along the way.</p>
            <br>
            <p>65 year old faculty theorist. Very proficient. Learned from books, keeping up with modern standards as they were developed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>25 year old graduate student. Very proficient. Learned from a 'Computing systems' class that taught C. After that, C++ was a logical jump with easier memory management.</p>
            <br>
            <p>35 year old postdoc theorist. Proficient. Very strong Python coder (object-oriented to the max). Learned from books, but really learned by coding toy projects on the side. Suggested going to coding-specific conferences to take advantage of workshops that are also run alongside.</p>
