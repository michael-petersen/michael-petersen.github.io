            <h2>Visa application (part 4)</h2>
            <br>
	          <p>I find myself, yet again, applying for a visa. This time, I'm applying under a new route, the 'Global Talent' visa for the UK. To even apply for the endorsement, I have for fork over Â£456!</p>
            <br>
            <p>This process is more of a faff that I expected. I have to first apply for an endorsement that enables me to then later apply for the Global Talent visa.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The endorsement phase is fairly painless if you do have a fellowship, which the Royal Society will endorse.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also had to pay 3070.00 (EUR) for the NHS surcharge. Also another 187.00 EUR to complete the application. Then we have to use the TLS racket service, which is an additional 158 EUR for a 'Flexi Appointment' because there are no free appointments available.</p>
