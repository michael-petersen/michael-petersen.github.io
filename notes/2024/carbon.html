            <h2>Calculation Carbon Footprint</h2>
        	  <p>I use my laptop for a bunch of basic to not-so-basic calculations. I'm not sure what the carbon cost of these calculations is, but I'd like to be able to keep track of it!</p>
              <br>
              <p>I have a voltmeter that I've used for tracking other power usage in my life, but this is the first time I've given measuring power usage from calculations on my laptop.</p>
              <br>
              <p><i>This is appropos of nothing, but I was curious and had some time to kill while these runs executed. When running pyMultiNest, fully charged M1 mac power draw jumps from 7W to 22W (+15W). Models take approximately 10 minutes to run, or 2.5Wh=0.0025kWh. With UK domestic pricing of 25p/kWh, the approximate cost is then 0.04p (that is, 25 calculations cost 1p). Assuming <a href="https://electricinsights.co.uk/#/homepage?&_k=lehyfi">200g/kWh</a>, each calculation is about 0.4g CO2. According to Activity Monitor, I am successfully using all four performance cores to complete this calculation.</i></p>
