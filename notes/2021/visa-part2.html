            <h2>Visa application (part 2)</h2>
            <br>
	          <p>My UK visa has just about run out, so it's time to apply for an extension. Amazingly, during the two years I've been in Edinburgh, the visa process has been completely overhauled, so the scheme I was under before (Tier 2) has now been converted to 'Skilled Worker'. It's not so different, but different enough that it takes some serious time to read the relevant information.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've now learned that you want to minimise the number of times you have to apply for a visa, because it's both a hassle, and expensive. To complete the application, I have for fork over both £723.20 in visa fees, as well as £936.00 in 'Immigration Health Surcharge'.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you are applying with a partner, it will be double both of these amounts. Yes, any good employer like the University of Edinburgh will reimburse these, but it's a big pain to be out this money in the first place: £1659.20 per person applying!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Then, you will have to schedule an appointment to get biometrics taken (as though these have changed in the past two years). Ideally, you will not be going through this process during a global pandemic, so your local UK office will be open. In my case, I have to go to Newcastle in order to get an appointment on any sort of reasonable timescale (the University didn't issue the new contract until my old one was running out, which made the timeline a bit compressed).
