            <p>I'm lucky enough to have had time on a number of different high-performance computing (HPC) setups across various institutes (eagle and unity at UMass, cuillin at the IfA in Edinburgh, infinity at the IAP in Paris). These are all great machines, but like all HPC setups, a bit idiosyncratic.
            <!--I am generally quite good about only using proper time allocations and resources, but sometimes the pain of learning a new system has been to great, and I've overstayed my welcome on older resources.

            <h3>EXP-specific advice</h3>
            <br>
            <p>You may have come here hoping to install EXP. Great! First things first, you should always be using the latest version of EXP -- things are changing all the time (always for the better, I promise!).</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>Almost all steps below are better run on a node of the cluster (i.e. a machine that will actually be using EXP)! To this end, a good first step is to check out a node for an interactive session to compile. </i>A basic checkout command looks like</p>
            <pre><code>srun -n8 --exclusive --pty $SHELL # for slurm
qsub -I -l nodes=1:ppn=8 # for PBS</code></pre>
            <!--srun -p cca --nodes=1 --ntasks=16 --pty $SHELL-->
            <p>Which will drop you at a terminal prompt on a node. Proceed...</p>
            <br>
            <p>The first thing to do is obtain EXP. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mdweinberg/exp/src/devel/">EXP lives on bitbucket</a>. If you do not have access, but should, let me know! Otherwise, the sequence of commands is standard git.</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">
              <i><span class="regularblack">SSH keys and bitbucket</span></i>
            </button>
            <div class="title collapsecontent">
              <p>The best way to give bitbucket your credentials is by registering your SSH key with bitbucket.</p>
              <p>If you navigate to your 'Personal Settings' on bitbucket, under 'Security', you will see 'SSH Keys'. Select 'Add Key', and then you need to paste in the key from the machine you'd like to copy the repository to. If you are copying the code to both your laptop and a cluster, you will need to do this process twice: the key pairs are different for every machine (that is, you will have different key pairs on every machine you use). <i>If you have not generated your key, run 'ssh-keygen -t rsa' (Feel free to use an empty passphrase but if any cluster manager asks, I [wink-wink] warned you not to do this).</i> To see your key, you can  'more ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' and simply copy-paste the result that is spit out into the bitbucket key prompt. Now you're ready to git! Note that these instructions also work for GitHub; you'll have to navigate the settings in a similar way to upload your public key.</p>
              <br>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>To 'git' the code from bitbucket,</p>
            <pre><code>git clone -b devel git@bitbucket.org:mdweinberg/exp.git
cd exp
git submodule update --init --recursive</code></pre>
            <p>The last line here sets up some external modules that EXP needs for installation: yaml-cpp and png++. These are submodules. This is it's own <a href="https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/">thing</a>, but again, helps to streamline the process.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="title collapsecontent">
              <p>Since EXP is operating in shared risk mode right now, you may have to install updates from time to time. To do so, you will get the most recent code from bitbucket, and then reinstall. Fortunately, git makes this easy.</p>
              <pre><code>git fetch    # to update the code, without attempted merge
git pull     # to update the code, with attempted merge
git log      # see recent repository changes, as recorded by git
git status   # see the current status of git, uncommitted code, changes, etc.</code></pre>
              <p>After updating code, you may proceed to the cmake and make steps below.</p>
              <br>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>Next step: EXP now uses cmake to set up compilation, so the next order of business is setting up the configurations correctly. From the exp directory, you need to make a workspace, and then execute the configuring command:</p>
            <pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake [options] ..</code></pre>
            <br>
            <p><i>Don't forget the trailing '..' in the cmake command to pick up the CMakeLists.txt file one directory up!</i> cmake will generate quite a lot of output, and will warn you if libraries are missing. In general, if the configuration doesn't complete, you should get an error message that makes sense; if can't make sense of the error, you can try sorting through the log or errors, in CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log and CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log. Since these files are huge, it typically makes sense to search in them using grep for specific keywords. If you see some final output like</p>
            <pre><code>Configuring build for devel/cb06b990c4f22aec9b5c76004bed0c43234be6bd at 2022-02-08 16:25:13 UTC

-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: ...</code></pre>
            <p>The configuration has likely been successful!</p>
            <br>
            <p>In general, cmake will warn you about missing variables. Typically it is as simple as setting the variable in the cmake command-line call, with the appropriate value (which you will have to track down!).</p>
            <br>
            <p>When compiling for <i>not</i> the first time, you may need to 'rm CMakeCache.txt' to remove any stale variables from the configuration process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To help with the cmake process, I'm also listing some working cmake configuration calls and notes, which fill out the options part of 'cmake [options]' instruction above. The specific configuration recipes work on the specific machines referenced above, but you may be able to draw inspiration from them!</p>

                <p>If you are on a linux machine (with superuser privileges!), you can 'sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev'. This will install by default in /usr/local/lib. You will likely have to specify whichever variable is missing above (e.g. FFTW_INCLUDE_DIRS, FFTW_ROOT, or FFTW_DOUBLE_LIB).</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you are on a shared cluster, you can check in the module files for an FFTW3 module, or install from source. If you install from source, you will have to specifically tell cmake where to look.</p>

              <p>One thing I've learned: if you are on a non-Ubuntu machine, you are more likely to have to tinker with CMakeLists.txt. This isn't a big deal, by itself! Don't be afraid to force include paths, e.g. by adding include_directories(/home/petersen/include/eigen3/) to CMakeLists.txt. You can also remove specific analysis programs if problematic.</p>

            <h3>What's under the hood (software)?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In my opinion, understanding the software framework of a supercomputer is the most important factor in getting to know a machine. The first order of business is figuring out what kind of a system we are on, because that will set a lot of the information we need later. Try:<p>
            <pre><code>cat /etc/os-release</code></pre>
            <p>(you can get all the same information with 'uname -a;sw_vers' on a Mac.) This will give you a bunch of report on the operating system. Ubuntu seems to be the most common, but you might also see CentOS.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One other key UNIX concept we can use for understanding the system is the 'env' command (short for environment). This is one of the most powerful ways to see what settings are being used.</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">
              <i><span class="regularblack">'env' command examples</span></i>
            </button>
            <div class="title collapsecontent">
              <p>Because it is so powerful, the output can be confoundingly opaque. Oftentimes I will use env in combination with 'grep' (global regular expression print) to search for specific pattens in the output. For example:</p>
              <pre><code>env | grep USER # outputs USER=petersen
env | grep HOME # outputs HOME=/home/petersen
env | grep SHELL # outputs SHELL=/bin/bash</code></pre>
              <p>You can reset variables (but some aren't settable!) with 'export ${VARIABLE}=VALUE'. Note that 'export' is bash specific (the name of the so-called shell). If you 'env | grep SHELL' and see something different (such as /bin/csh, or /bin/zsh), it's worth making a note that some commands in this note might be different.</p>
              <br>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>It's also often useful to know which version of an executable is being run. In particular, you can use this strategy to find libraries fairly efficiently. This brings up the useful command</p>
            <pre><code>which [executable]</code></pre>

            <br>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">
              <i><span class="regularblack">'which' command examples</span></i>
            </button>
            <div class="title collapsecontent">
              <p>For example:</p>
              <pre><code>which gcc</code></pre>
              <p>Here, I tested which gcc (the standard UNIX C compiler) is being used by the system as a default. When searching for software, 'locate' is your friend (if available). Oftentimes, you can track down a missing library and add an extra path simply by using locate.</p>
              <br>
              <p>You can also learn which libraries are specifically being called by an executable with the command 'ldd [executable]'. For instance, if we just obtained the full path to the gcc executable above, we can see which libraries gcc depends on by using:</p>
              <pre><code># specific to infinity!
ldd /softs/gcc/11.2.0-CentOS8/bin/gcc</code></pre>
              <p>ldd can be a useful debugging tool in the case of compiled programs with possible library confusion. The equivalent command on Mac OSX is 'otool -L [executable]'</p>
              <br>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>Another useful tool is to check out the module environment (assuming that's what is being used -- more likely than not these days!).</p>

              <i><span class="regularblack">Useful 'module'-related commands</span></i>
            </button>
            <div class="title collapsecontent">
              <p>There are a few useful commands here:</p>
              <pre><code>module avail                             # see list of available modules
module purge                             # un-load loaded modules
module load [modulename1] [modulename2]  # load modules (as many as you want at once!)
module list                              # list loaded modules</code></pre>
              <p>From the output of 'module avail' you will select the list of modules you want to then 'module load'. In general, it's reasonable to choose the highest possible version available; if you run into trouble, it can occasionally be worth backing off the version. The second line will unload all current modules, giving you a clean slate. For completeness, here are module sets (the output of 'module list') from some machines that can compile EXP, for inspiration:</p>
              <pre><code># unity (Ubuntu)
module load cuda/11.3.1 mpfr/4.1.0 gcc/10.2.0 boost/1.73.0 openmpi/4.1.0 eigen/3.3.7 gmp/6.2.0  mpc/1.1.0    vtk/8.2.0  cmake/3.15.0 python/3.9.1 fftw/3.3.8

# cuillin (Ubuntu)
module load cuda/11.6 gcc/10.2 hdf5-openmpi

# infinity (CentOS)
module load cmake intelpython/3-2022.0.2 gcc/11.2.0 gsl/2.7.1 cuda/11.7 inteloneapi/2022.2 openmpi/4.1.3-gnu

# CCA iron cluster (from Martin Weinberg)
module load modules-new; module load boost vtk cmake cuda eigen emacs fftw gcc hdf5 openmpi

# Columbia Ginsburg cluster (from Courtney Carter)
module load hdf5/1.10.1 slurm/20.02.6 openmpi/gcc/64/1.10.7 gcc/10.2.0 openblas/dynamic/0.3.7 cmake 3.22.1 fftw3/openmpi/gcc/64/3.3.8</code></pre>
              <p>These follow pretty standard module file naming conventions, namely, the library followed by the version number. If troubleshooting, you will want to send the output of 'module avail;module list' so the troubleshooter can see what's available on the system.</p>
              <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br><br>
            <p>We also need to figure out whether we are on a <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html">slurm</a> system or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System">PBS</a> system. Try either 'sinfo' (slurm) or 'qstat' (PBS) to figure out which one works! Examples to be added here...</p>

            <h3>What's under the hood (hardware)?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Hardware is also important. To that end, it's worth looking at seeing what kind of documentation is available. At the same time, I have always found the documentation to be lacking in some way, so I am more inclined to investigate myself and try to get a feel for what's available. For example, to get a sense of what's happening on cuillin, you can try <a href="https://gist.github.com/michael-petersen/38012e1e1d83eb6740e08212c7e456d3">this gist</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You could also put something similar in your queue scripts and build up machine knowledge along with your jobs. Hopefully this can help with planning jobs across nodes with similar architecture. Note of course that you have to have SSH privileges into the nodes, which is not a guarantee on your machine (not having SSH is a pain, and you'll likely be working closely with the cluster manager at that point!)</p>

            <h3>Working with module files</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In the wild west of cluster management, modules can help a lot. However, some module files have not yet been written, depending on the module and the cluster maintenance (cuillin is a bit wilder than other clusters). To get started, read <a href="https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_modulefile_examples.html">this tutorial</a>. On cuillin, the software issues log is located <a href="https://cuillin.roe.ac.uk/projects/cuillin-software/issues">here</a>. For instance, a couple relevant links on cuillin:<p>
            <pre><code># modules will search the following file paths:
/etc/environment-modules/modulespath
# Ubuntu-provided packages should go in /usr/share, not /usr/local
# for example:
cd /usr/share/modules/modulefiles
more /usr/local/Modules/modulefiles/cuda/11.6</code></pre>
            <p>To hunt for a particular module requires a bit of knowledge of the file system. It's generally possible to ascertain where the modulefiles will be from looking at the ultimate root, '/'. On the various machines:</p>
            <pre><code># unity
more /modules/modulefiles/hdf5/1.12.0.lua
# appPath = "/modules/apps/hdf5/1.12.0"</code></pre>
