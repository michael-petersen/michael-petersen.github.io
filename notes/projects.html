              <h3>Simulation analysis with a target code release</h3>
              <p><i>These projects are suitable for a 8-12 week time frame. The deliverable for each project is a public release (i.e. on GitHub) of an example astrophysical application. These projects require some level of comfort with one of the following computer languages: Python, C++, Julia.</i></p>

            <p><b>1. Computing galaxy property uncertainties using the Bayesian beta distribution quantile technique.</b>
            When considering a population of objects with a binary classification system (e.g. 'Does this galaxy contain a bar? yes/no'), it is straightforward to compute the number of each binary classification. However, estimating the uncertainty is not straightfoward. One technique to estimate confidence intervals relies on the binomial distribution. Following the algorithm laid out in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PASA...28..128C/citations">Cameron (2010)</a>, in this project we will apply the binomial classification to barred galaxies in a cosmological simulation, and design software for release.

            <p><b>2. Dark matter velocity distribution descriptions with Bayesian blocks histogram technique.</b>
            Binning quantities to create a histogram of values is a fundamental technique for compactly displaying data. Recently (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211115440D/abstract">Donaldson et al 2022</a>), we characterised velocity distributions for dark matter particles in the solar neighbourhood using histograms. However, we can improve on the histogram using a novel technique called 'Bayesian blocks' <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...504..405S/abstract">(Scargle 1998)</a>. In this project, we will design a software package to perform Bayesian block calculations and apply the software to velocity distributions of particles in the solar neighbourhood, looking for features that depart from a smooth distribution -- possible indications of relic substructure from undigested galaxies.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>3. Comparing dark matter velocity distributions from simulations, using the upgraded Kolmogorov-Smirnov techniques and survival analysis.</b> Recently (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211115440D/abstract">Donaldson et al 2022</a>), we characterised velocity distributions for dark matter particles in the solar neighbourhood using cumulative density functions (CDFs). CDFs allow for direct comparison between multiple distributions, with a half-century of statistics underpinning. In the first part of the project, we will develop a software package that is a clean implementation of CDF comparison techniques. Then, we will extend the analysis to so-called 'censored data', where some observations are missing -- a very typical problem in astronomy! Following algorithms laid out in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJ...293..192F/abstract">Feigelson & Nelson (1985)</a>, we will extend the software package to mimic real observations for dark matter detectors based on extracts of Milky Way-like galaxies from cosmological simulations.

              <h3>Fundamental linear algebra algorithm development</h3>
              <p><i>These projects are suitable for a 6-9 month time frame. The deliverable for each project is a pedagogical mathematical writeup of a newly-developed algorithm (with the possibility for extension to a journal submission). These projects require some computer programming (described on a per-project basis), but will mainly be focused on mathematical development.</i></p>

            <p><b>1. Analysing RR Lyrae stars with M-SSA (Multichannel Singular Spectral Analysis).</b>In a recent paper, we brought a machine learning technique from climate science to astrophysics (Weinberg & Petersen 2021). The technique has proved particularly fruitful for analysing simulations of galaxies. However, the technique is much more general than just galaxy simulations: M-SSA can pull repeat signals out of (almost) any time series data. In this project, we'll let M-SSA loose on a real data set from the Kepler telescope, which observed a number of bright RR Lyrae-type variable stars. During the project, we will extend the existing M-SSA framework to handle censored (missing) data. We will then look for standard oscillation periods and build  templates for even more sparse datasets.</p>
