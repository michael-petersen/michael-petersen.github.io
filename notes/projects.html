            <p><b>1. Computing galaxy property uncertainties using the Bayesian beta distribution quantile technique.</b>
            When considering a population of objects with a binary classification system (e.g. 'Does this galaxy contain a bar? yes/no'), it is straightforward to compute the number of each binary classification. However, estimating the uncertainty is not straightfoward. One technique to estimate confidence intervals relies on the binomial distribution. Following the algorithm laid out in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PASA...28..128C/citations">Cameron (2010)</a>, in this project we will apply the binomial classification to barred galaxies in a cosmological simulation, and design software for release.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>2. Dark matter velocity distribution descriptions with Bayesian blocks histogram technique.</b>
            Binning quantities to create a histogram of values is a fundamental technique for compactly displaying data. Recently (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211115440D/abstract">Donaldson et al 2022</a>), we characterised velocity distributions for dark matter particles in the solar neighbourhood using histograms. However, we can improve on the histogram using a novel technique called 'Bayesian blocks' <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...504..405S/abstract">(Scargle 1998)</a>. In this project, we will design a software package to perform Bayesian block calculations and apply the software to velocity distributions of particles in the solar neighbourhood, looking for features that depart from a smooth distribution -- possible indications of relic substructure from undigested galaxies.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>3. Comparing dark matter velocity distributions from simulations, using the upgraded Kolmogorov-Smirnov techniques and survival analysis.</b> Recently (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211115440D/abstract">Donaldson et al 2022</a>), we characterised velocity distributions for dark matter particles in the solar neighbourhood using cumulative density functions (CDFs). CDFs allow for direct comparison between multiple distributions, with a half-century of statistics underpinning. In the first part of the project, we will develop a software package that is a clean implementation of CDF comparison techniques. Then, we will extend the analysis to so-called 'censored data', where some observations are missing -- a very typical problem in astronomy! Following algorithms laid out in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJ...293..192F/abstract">Feigelson & Nelson (1985)</a>, we will extend the software package to mimic real observations for dark matter detectors based on extracts of Milky Way-like galaxies from cosmological simulations.

              <h3>Fundamental linear algebra algorithm development</h3>
              <p><i>These projects are suitable for a 6-9 month time frame. The deliverable for each project is a pedagogical mathematical writeup of a newly-developed algorithm (with the possibility for extension to a journal submission). These projects require some computer programming (described on a per-project basis), but will mainly be focused on mathematical development. These projects may be suitable as the start of a PhD project.</i></p>

            <p><b>1. Analysing RR Lyrae stars with M-SSA (Multichannel Singular Spectral Analysis).</b>In a recent paper, we brought a machine learning technique from climate science to astrophysics (Weinberg & Petersen 2021). The technique has proved particularly fruitful for analysing simulations of galaxies. However, the technique is much more general than just galaxy simulations: M-SSA can pull repeat signals out of (almost) any time series data. In this project, we'll let M-SSA loose on a real data set from the Kepler telescope, which observed a number of bright RR Lyrae-type variable stars. During the project, we will extend the existing M-SSA framework to handle censored (missing) data. We will then look for standard oscillation periods and build  templates for even more sparse datasets.</p>

            <p><b>3. Characterising simulated orbits with Manifold Learning.</b>T here's a whole industry built around describing the structure of galaxies using computational techniques (e.g. for a recent example, see
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..124M/abstract">Miller & van Dokkum 2021</a>). Basis function expansions are a natural way to compress information, but haven't been applied in any significant way to galaxy data (despite the idea being around for almost 50 years for simulations! <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976ApJ...205..745K/abstract">Kalnajs 1976</a>) In Section 5.3 of this paper, we lay out some mathematics to do face-on descriptions of galactic discs.
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.5408W/abstract">Weinberg & Petersen</a>
We used the Fourier-Laguerre expansion on simulated data, but I'd like to think about applying it to real data. The project would be about developing the mathematics behind the expansions, and then applying the expansions to real data. There are some big improvements to be made to the Fourier-Laguerre basis: in particular, we could use PCA-like procedures to define a new empirical basis to even more efficiently compress the information. The point of the information compression is to have some sort of uniform way of describing galaxies so that we can look for structural trends. I have a bunch of ideas on this front, but I think we'd start by describing the structure of spiral arms. We'd also build N-body models out of the basis function expansions that could be integrated.</p>

            <p><b>1. Triaxiality measurement in idealised galaxies.</b> Most galaxies in cosmological simulations appear to be triaxial. What does this mean for morphological structure?</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>2. Spin parameter and distribution in cosmological halos.</b> We've known for twenty+ years that galactic dark matter halos have some angular momentum (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...555..240B/abstract">Bullock et al. 2001</a>). The angular momentum distribution has implications for the type of structure that can form in the disc inside these halos. In some pilot simulations, I found that the galactic bars that formed in dark matter halos were sensitive to the structure of the angular momentum profile (an idea also developed in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488.5788C/abstract">Collier et al. 2021</a>). I'd be interested in investigating these implications with more rigor, by designing a tandem suite of analytic linear stability models, and also releasing more N-body models. This project has the benefit that we could also try to draw in some of the large-scale structure simulation people.</p>
