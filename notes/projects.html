            <h3>Simulation analysis with a target code release</h3>
            <p>
            <b>1. Computing uncertainties Bayesian beta distribution quantile technique.</b>
            When considering a population of objects with a binary classification system (e.g. 'Does this galaxy contain a bar? yes/no'), it is straightforward to compute the number of each binary classification. However, estimating the uncertainty is not straightfoward. One technique to estimate confidence intervals relies on the binomial distribution. Following the algorithm laid out in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PASA...28..128C/citations">Cameron (2010)</a>, in this project we will apply the binomial classification to barred galaxies in a cosmological simulation, and design software for release.

            <b>2. Velocity distribution descriptions with Bayesian blocks histogram technique.</b>
            Binning quantities to create a histogram of values is a fundamental technique for compactly displaying data. Recently (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=%20author%3A%22%5Edonaldson%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc">Donaldson et al 2022</a>), we characterised velocity distributions for dark matter particles in the solar neighbourhood using histograms. However, we can improve on the histogram using a novel technique called 'Bayesian blocks' <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...504..405S/abstract">(Scargle 1998)</a>. In this project, we will design a software package to perform Bayesian block calculations and apply the software to velocity distributions of particles in the solar neighbourhood, looking for features that depart from a smooth distribution -- possible indications of relic substructure from undigested galaxies.

            <b>3. Comparing velocity distributions from simulations, using the upgraded Kolmogorov-Smirnov techniques and survival analysis.</b> Recently (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=%20author%3A%22%5Edonaldson%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc">Donaldson et al 2022</a>), we characterised velocity distributions for dark matter particles in the solar neighbourhood using cumulative density functions (CDFs). CDFs allow for direct comparison between multiple distributions, with a half-century of statistics underpinning. In the first part of the project, we will develop a software package that is a clean implementation of CDF comparison techniques. Then, we will extend the analysis to so-called 'censored data', where some observations are missing -- a very typical problem in astronomy! Following algorithms laid out in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJ...293..192F/abstract">Feigelson & Nelson (1985)</a>, we will extend the software package to mimic real observations for dark matter detectors based on extracts of Milky Way-like galaxies from cosmological simulations.
