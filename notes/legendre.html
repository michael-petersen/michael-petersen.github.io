            <h2>Legendre Recursion</h2>
	    <p>I've been interested in stable recursions for a bit now, and finally had the incentive to go through and write an improved Legendre recursion (that doesn't try to multiply a really big number by a really little number just to get close to unity) The full example can be found as a GitHub gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/michael-petersen/5943ec2d7697ea61c1c982a78ff661f4">here</a>, but I'll try to explain a bit better in this note.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is a C++ code, but the ideas are generic. My general goal going forward is to write better recursions to minimise numerical errors -- this is a start!</p>

              <code>
clang++ -I/opt/local/include/eigen3 -o legendre legendre_test.cpp
              </code>
