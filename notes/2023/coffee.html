            <h2>Coffee Carbon Footprint</h2>
        	    <p>At the risk of being a stereotype of an academic, I like coffee.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I recently purchased an espresso machine for my flat as an absurd luxury: a Rubino Luxe Heat Exchanger. I'm sure I'll write about the machine and coffee elsewhere. I also simultaneously was reading the book <i>How bad are bananas?</i> by Mike Berners-Lee, in which he recommends getting a plug adapter that will check the wattage draw of an appliance. This got me thinking: how much carbon am I spending to have a coffee (ignoring the obvious cost of getting the beans to me for now)? Is there some ideal method I should be using?</p>
              <br>
              <p>For a physics-y angle here, there is a 1500W heating element powering a 3L boiler. It takes 1000 calories to heat 1L of water by a degree, 1 calorie is 0.24 Watts per second, and I'm probably going from roughly 25C to 100C (75C). I've observed (using the Watt meter) that it takes about 7 minutes (420 seconds) to heat up the boiler. That suggests I'm adding 420*1500*0.24 = 151kcal to the water, enough to raise 3L by 50 degrees. I'm a little suspicious at this point, because that seems to good to be true. A mystery! My leading theory is that the machine isn't actually filling 3L of water, but maybe closer to 2L. I could test by fully draining the machine at some point and measuring the water.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Note that the pump in the espresso machine also draws about 60W when running (pulling the shot), which lasts 30 seconds, so there is some non-zero cost there. But really, to get a fair cost, I have to consider how many shots I'm pulling when turning on the machine, and how often the heater runs. To be measured. In theory, though, let's say I did just fire up the machine for one shot. I've used (420*1500 + 30*60)=630kWs=0.175kWh. At current electricity rates, 35p/kWh (2023), that means it costs 6.25p to pull a shot. [Update: 16 Aug 2024, energy is 23.52p/kWh, so turning on the machine to pull a single shot now costs 4.12p.]</p>
              <br>
              <p>I also checked my kettle. It's a pretty standard-looking one that came with the flat. When I fired up the Watt measurement, it drew a whopping 2500W (similar to the dryer, which I also tested for fun). It blew through 1L of water to boiling in 2 minutes (120 seconds). Running through similar math as above, 120*2500*0.24 = 72kcal, enough to raise 1L of water by 72 degrees. That seems about right for back of the envelope, so what gives in the espresso machine? 1L of water is about right to make a Chemex pour-over (my other go-to method), by the time one has warmed the Chemex, warmed the cups, and poured 500g of water through. Maybe I could get away with a little less.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Now with a new kettle (August 2024), I found it draws 3000W for when the heater is engaged, and took 133s to bring 1L of water to boiling. Following heating calculations, this is 133*3000*0.24 = 95.7kcal, which in theory can raise 1L of water by 95.7 degrees. This seems too large, in that I doubt the water from the tap starts at 5C. I may need to do more robust litre measurements for input. Incidentally, to heat 1L of water takes about 0.11kWh according to this calculation, so it costs something like 2.5p to heat the water.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I also checked the grinder (a Niche Zero). This was pretty fun, because (like the other machines) there is a negligible pull when simply powered up (of the order 0.1W), but when the motor is engaged, that jumps to 24W. But, when coffee is added and the motor engaged (i.e. the typical use case), the wattage jumps to 100W. This also takes about 30 seconds, or roughly the same energy as the pump action for the shot itself.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I get a bi-weekly coffee subscription from Machina, and I finally looked more carefully at the packaging. Royal Mail estimates that the average parcel carbon footprint is 218g CO2e.</p>

These are the burrs in the Niche Zero:

Let's say coffee beans cost £12/250g. For a 18g dose, this works out to 86p per espresso shot. Compared to the cost of electricity to pull the shot, the beans are the dominant cost.

The espresso machine itself was £1100. Conservatively, I've been pulling two shots a day for 1.5 years, so that's 1.5*365*2=1095 shots. This works out to £1 per shot. The grinder was £500, and I've been using it for 1.5 years, so that's 1.5*365*2=1095 shots. This works out to 50p per shot. If I assume the machine lasts 10 years, that's 10*365*2=7300 shots, or 15p per shot. If I assume the grinder lasts 10 years, that's 10*365*2=7300 shots, or 7p per shot. The beans will be the dominant cost per shot after using the same machine for two years.

I'm not sure how to calculate the carbon footprint of the beans themselves, but I could look into it. I could also look into the carbon footprint of the milk I use. I could also look into the carbon footprint of the water I use. I could also look into the carbon footprint of the sugar I use. I could also look into the carbon footprint of the cup I use. I could also look into the carbon footprint of the grinder I use. I could also look into the carbon footprint of the espresso machine I use. I could also look into the carbon footprint of the kettle I use. I could also look into the carbon footprint of the water filter I use. I could also look into the carbon footprint of the beans I use.
