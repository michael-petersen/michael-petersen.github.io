            <h2>Bicycle Commuting</h2>
              <p>(This post is backdated to when I got my current bicycle, but it features more recent updates: most recently 4 November 2024.)</p>
              <br>
        	    <p>I've been regularly commuting by bicycle for a number of years while living in Western Massachusetts, but I finally kicked it up a notch after moving to Edinburgh in 2019, with no more car in the picture. The University of Edinburgh has a reasonably generous cycle-to-work scheme that can help defray the upfront cost of purchasing a bicycle by allowing for pre-tax deductions from your salary.</p>
              <br>
              <p>With help from the UoE, I purchased a Norco Indie from Evans Cycles, 58 cm, on 1 August 2019. I didn't get to pick up the bicycle until 11 October 2019, and a new era began! The bicycle itself was £560, then with all the accessories (paniers, rack, jacket, gloves, helmet, lights), the total came to an even £1000.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The goal for this note is to record the costs associated with bicycle commuting. I expect that on an annualised basis, the cost will be quite low, even if I am occasionally annoyed when I have to get my bicycle serviced.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>As of 2024, the estimated per-year cost for everything associated with cycling to work is £284. This works out to a bit less than £1 per commute.</b></p>
