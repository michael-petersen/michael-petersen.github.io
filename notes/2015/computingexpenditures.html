            <h2>How much computing budget do I need?</h2>
            <p>(This post is backdated to when I switched to my current setup, but it features more recent updates: most recently 26 May 2022.)</p>
            <br>
        	  <p>I fully admit that I'm a bit weird about spending grant money and new computers. I've personally purchased all of the laptops that I use for science research (although I'm a huge proponent of shared resources, and computing clusters), and I use the computers as workhorses for absolutely everything I want to do with a computer. I fully admit that I waited too long to upgrade my first graduate school laptop, which I write more about below. It is also possible I waited to long to upgrade my first postdoc laptop.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To that end, I try to both (a) keep compulsive track of how much I'm spending, and (b) try to understand as much as possible why I am investing in something. I'm also counting all my computer peripherals.</p>

            <h3>Postdoc II (2022-)</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I'm currently on a MacBook Air (M1, 2020). I ordered this machine on May 19th, 2022, from Apple.com, for $1,509. I also attempted to future-proof this machine, buy purchasing the Apple M1 chip with 8‑core CPU, 8‑core GPU, and 16‑core Neural Engine, 16GB unified memory, and 1TB SSD. Mac watchers will say this was a bad time to upgrade, as a new line is expected in Fall 2022. I am less convinced, but time will tell.</p>

            <h3>Grad School II/Postdoc I (2015-2022)</h3>
            <br>
            <p>From May 2015 to May 2022, I was on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). I ordered this machine on April 27th, 2015. I purchased this machine from Apple.com, for $1,878. Crucially, I chose to try and 'future-proof' this machine by upgrading to the 3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz, with 16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM, and 256GB PCIe-based Flash Storage. In the end, the 256GB storage turns out to be the bottleneck that I've had to wrestle with.</p>

            <h3>Grad School I (2010-2015)</h3>
            <br>
            <p>From June 2010 to May 2015, I was on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2010). I purchased this machine off the shelf for $1,049, in person, in MA. As this machine was part of a generation where computers could be more easily modified, I upgraded this computer myself in two stages, to prolong its life. In retrospect, I should have gotten a more powerful processor to start. It is still currently working as a backup! However, the OS has reached the absolute maximum that will ever be supported (10.13), so the days are relatively numbered. <i>As of 2022, homebrew will no longer support 10.13.6, so failures are starting to pop up in compiler-related projects.</i></p>

Gigabit to USB-C ethernet adapter, $29.99
USB-C to HDMI/USB/USB-C, $69.99

I repaired the 2020 MBA at SimplyFixIt in Bruntsfield. (Nov 21, 2023)
Owing to some known liquid damage, I had an inspection for £129, which also covered sonic cleaning of the parts to prevent corrosion.
This resulted in additional findings, of a screen replacement for £349, and audio board replacement for £99.

2020 MBA environmental report: https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/notebooks/13-inch_MacBookAir_PER_Nov2020.pdf


In January 2022, I upgraded to MBP 2015 to macOS Catalina, 10.15.7

I've always been fortunate enough to have access to external monitors through offices. These are a cost that I would need if I decided to work elsewhere!

In France, I bought several peripherials to make my life easier.
External Keyboard
External mouse
Headset
Microphone (not strictly needed)
Laptop stand


I repaired the 2015 MBP at SimplyFixIt in Bruntsfield. (May 14, 2021)

First was an inspection, for £99. FAULT SYMPTOMS / PROBLEM : Touch pad and keyboard not working
intermittently
JOB REQUESTED BY CUSTOMER:
Please investigate and update
customer
BOOK-IN INSPECTION: Screen coating peeling away and palmrest edge has damage

I then spent an additional £327 on May 18, 2021 to replace the cable connecting the power adapter, the cable connecting the keyboard and mouse setup, and the battery.

Original order. I maxed out many of the options to try and make the computer live as long as possible.
13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display

$1,878.00

With the following configuration:

•	3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz
•	16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM
•	256GB PCIe-based Flash Storage
•	Intel Iris Graphics 6100
•	Force Touch trackpad
•	Accessory Kit
•	Backlit Keyboard (English) & User's Guide
•	Apple Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter

(environmental report at https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/notebooks/13inchMacBookPro_wRetinaDisplay_PER_march2015.pdf)

I also bought at $9.99 MagSafe to MagSafe 2 converter.

To cover the computer, I bought a hard side rubberised case for $24.99 (still going as of Jan 2022)
I also bought a keyboard cover for $7.95, which is very broken in Jan 2022, but also tells a super interesting story of exactly how I type.

Also external hard drives:
4 TB western digital <- new time machine
500GB SanDisk (workhorse)
1TB SanDisk
1TB external (brand?) <- old time machine
32GB sticks (real thesis workhorses!)
-->

I'd also be lying if I said I didn't use my phone for work from time to time. I will also count it as part of the cost!

I got my iPhone 6s in late October 2015, retailing for $749 as the 64GB model.

https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility

First smartphone was an iPhone 5, 16 GB, purchased 25 August 2013.

Old notes:
I bought Corsair Apple 8 GB Dual Channel Kit DDR3 1066 (PC3 8500) 204-Pin DDR3 Laptop SO-DIMM Memory for $37.99 in August 2016. I also had to buy Torx scredrivers at the same time.

I paid $1049 for the original Macbook pro laptop.

This computer is maxed out at macOS High Sierra 10.13.6

2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (1 processor, 2 cores). 3 MB L2 cache.
Started with 4 GB memry, later upgraded.

Purchased a Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250GB to upgrade the spinning drive. This was easily the biggest difference in the machine's lifespan.

Purchased a new battery (when?). Jan 2022: 3510 mAh charge, 189 cycles. 90 mA, 9662 mV.

One new wall charger purchased.
